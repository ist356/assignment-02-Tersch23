## Instructions

Reflection is a key activity of learning. It helps you build a strong metacognition, or "understanding of your own learning." A good learner not only "knows what they know", but they "know what they don't know", too. Learning to reflect takes practice, but if your goal is to become a self-directed learner where you can teach yourself things, reflection is imperative.

- Now that you've completed the assignment, share your throughts. What did you learn? What confuses you? Where did you struggle? Where might you need more practice?
- A good reflection is: **specific as possible**,  **uses the terminology of the problem domain** (what was learned in class / through readings), and **is actionable** (you can pursue next steps, or be aided in the pursuit). That last part is what will make you a self-directed learner.
- Flex your recall muscles. You might have to review class notes / assigned readings to write your reflection and get the terminology correct.
- Your reflection is for **you**. Yes I make you write them and I read them, but you are merely practicing to become a better self-directed learner. If you read your reflection 1 week later, does what you wrote advance your learning?

Examples:

- **Poor Reflection:**  "I don't understand loops."   
**Better Reflection:** "I don't undersand how the while loop exits."   
**Best Reflection:** "I struggle writing the proper exit conditions on a while loop." It's actionable: You can practice this, google it, ask Chat GPT to explain it, etc. 
-  **Poor Reflection** "I learned loops."   
**Better Reflection** "I learned how to write while loops and their difference from for loops."   
**Best Reflection** "I learned when to use while vs for loops. While loops are for sentiel-controlled values (waiting for a condition to occur), vs for loops are for iterating over collections of fixed values."

What did you learn?
- Ok, I have learned a little about parsing data, creating functions and using them, and also using the debug and testing to my advantage. I have learned a little, I am still very confused and this whole thing has me going a little crazy.
What confuses you?
- I am confused with just about everything, I need to spend a lot of time on this class. I am confused about VS code, github, and the terms we use like push pull clone and fork. Every class session I learn a ton but I struggle learning by myself outside of the classroom. 
Where did you struggle?
- I struggled doing the assignment, turning it in, and commiting and syncing. I know these should be easy things but when I get stuck without resources telling me if I am going down the right path or spiriling even deeper, I struggle. 
Where might you need more practice?
- I need practice with this new software. VS Code is hard, i might need to get a tutor or just attend office hours regularly. I want to learn how to do this stuff i know it may be hard and complicated but once I get it down I feel will much better.
